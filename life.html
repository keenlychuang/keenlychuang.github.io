                <p>I have some of my best and worst ideas drinking coffee. There are the great moments: following a ritual to brew that crucial morning espresso, appreciating a fresh grind that smells like poetry, and sharing a flavorful cup and conversation with cozy companion.</p> 
                <p>Then there are the other aspects: the late-night delusional promise of focus, the jitters and anxiety of too many sips, or that annoying stain you can never quite get out of your white shirt. </p>
                <p>In search of more novel qualties, I’ve been looking to explore the best places for coffee in the DMV area, rating each subjectively by criteria like wifi-speed, seating, ambiance, treats, and of course, coffee quality. I’m always happy to receive recommendations! </p>

                <p>A great book is like a great friend. They have something meaningful to say. Their character sticks with you, even when you might forget the specifics. They let you take your time, and you can approach them at your own pace. Engaging is like a conversation; you’re generating, inferring, and reflecting, not just passively consuming. Thanks to my family, I grew up with a great appreciation for storytelling and literature, which has persisted to this day. </p> 
                <p>I would always look forward to our visits to the local library on weekends, and my eventual summers volunteering there. I would look forward to seeing what the new arrivals were and which books I’d be able to read for school. My parents would take me to Barnes and Noble or Borders and leave me for hours to read the true latest releases, and my family even discovered which days the most recent magazines were recycled at my local post office. I still feel most at home in places where I can read peacefully. </p>
                <p>It feels like more than a skill, and I'm doing my best to stay in touch with the habit of reading. Through book clubs with strangers, friends, and coworkers—driven by both curiosity and obligation—I'm recording and reviewing the titles that stand out most. Feel free to take a look! </p>
