                <p>Coffee is more than caffeine—it's ritual, craft, and discovery. From pour-over experiments to espresso dialing, I explore the intersection of science and art in every cup. My current setup includes a Hario V60, Fellow Ode grinder, and an ever-rotating selection of single-origin beans from local roasters. Each morning becomes a small experiment: adjusting grind size, water temperature, and timing to unlock different flavor notes. There's something deeply satisfying about the precision required—the way a few grams or degrees can transform bitter into bright, flat into complex. I'm particularly drawn to naturally processed Ethiopian beans and the fruit-forward profiles they offer, though a well-executed Colombian or Guatemalan can be equally revelatory.</p>

                <p>Reading shapes thinking. I gravitate toward philosophy, technology, design, and fiction that challenges assumptions. Books are conversations across time. My reading spans from Ursula K. Le Guin's speculative fiction to Don Norman's design principles, from Seneca's stoic meditations to contemporary works on artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. I'm drawn to authors who blur boundaries—philosophers who write like poets, technologists who think like humanists, fiction writers who grapple with real ethical dilemmas. Recent favorites include Jenny Odell's "How to Do Nothing," Klara Kristalova's explorations of digital culture, and anything by Jorge Luis Borges. I keep detailed notes on passages that resonate, connections between seemingly unrelated works, and questions that emerge from the margins. Reading isn't passive consumption—it's active dialogue with ideas that have shaped and continue to shape our world.</p>
