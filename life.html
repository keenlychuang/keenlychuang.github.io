                <p>I have some of my best and worst ideas drinking coffee. There are the great moments: following a ritual to brew that crucial morning espresso, appreciating a fresh grind that smells like poetry, and sharing a flavorful cup and conversation with cozy companion.</p> 
                <p>Then there are the other aspects: the late-night delusional promise of focus, the jitters and anxiety of too many sips, or that annoying stain you can never quite get out of your white shirt. </p>
                <p>In search of more novel qualties, I’ve been looking to explore the best places for coffee in the DMV area, rating each subjectively by criteria like wifi-speed, seating, ambiance, treats, and of course, coffee quality. I’m always happy to receive recommendations! </p>

                <p>Reading shapes thinking. I gravitate toward philosophy, technology, design, and fiction that challenges assumptions. Books are conversations across time. My reading spans from Ursula K. Le Guin's speculative fiction to Don Norman's design principles, from Seneca's stoic meditations to contemporary works on artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction.</p> 
                <p>I'm drawn to authors who blur boundaries—philosophers who write like poets, technologists who think like humanists, fiction writers who grapple with real ethical dilemmas. Recent favorites include Jenny Odell's "How to Do Nothing," Klara Kristalova's explorations of digital culture, and anything by Jorge Luis Borges. </p>
                <p>I keep detailed notes on passages that resonate, connections between seemingly unrelated works, and questions that emerge from the margins. Reading isn't passive consumption—it's active dialogue with ideas that have shaped and continue to shape our world.</p>
